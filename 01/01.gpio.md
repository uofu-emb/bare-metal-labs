# GPIO

## Objectives

1. Set up, Manipulate GPIO pins
2. Build HAL Library
3. Design Unit Tests

## Storyboard

1. Give Students function `Err startGPIO_C6()`
   1. It's missing `RCC->AHBENR |= RCC_AHBENR_GPIOCEN;` they need to add it
   2. Have them explain the rest of the function
2. Students must expand the function to set up *any* GPIOC pin `void startGPIOCx()`
   1. use pointer here
3. Students must expand that function to set up *any* GPIO pin `void startGPIOx(GPIOx, pin, in/out)`
4. Tie small circuit (switch?) to GPIO pin, leds react to circuit state (on, off)
